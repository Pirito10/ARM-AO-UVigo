# ARM Thumb Exercises
These are **ARM Thumb Assembly Exercises** developed as part of the course "[Arquitectura de Ordenadores](https://secretaria.uvigo.gal/docnet-nuevo/guia_docent/index.php?centre=305&ensenyament=V05G306V01&assignatura=V05G306V01109&any_academic=2020_21)" in the Telecommunications Engineering Degree at the Universidad de Vigo (2020 - 2021).

## About The Project
These exercises focus on ARM assembly programming, showcasing fundamental low-level programming concepts such as:
- Register-based computation.
- Stack management.
- Function calls and parameter passing.
- Memory access and data manipulation.
- Bitwise operations and control flow.

## How To Run
### Requirements
Make sure you have [QtARMSim](https://lorca.act.uji.es/project/qtarmsim/) installed on your system.

### Usage
1. Open QtARMSim.
2. Load the desired assembly file (`.s`).
3. Step through the instructions or run the program to observe its execution.
